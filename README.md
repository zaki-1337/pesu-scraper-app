# pesu-scraper-app
This is the scraper functionality embedded into an easy-to-use desktop app.

Usage:
1. "npm install" in directory.
2. "node main.js" to run the app.

Where's the desktop app?
We need to build the app with electron forge. Look here: https://www.electronforge.io

Note:
This is still very early in development. It has been tested only for the CSE department. Will test the others soon.
